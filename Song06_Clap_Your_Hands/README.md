# Clap Your Hands - சகல ஜனங்களே நீங்கள் கைகொட்டுங்களேன்

This song of triumphant communal praise echoes Psalm 47 — “Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy! For the Lord, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth.” It calls every nation to worship the sovereign King who subdues enemies and chooses His people. In the eternal day, this praise is perfected — every tribe and tongue clapping and shouting hallelujah before the Lamb (Revelation 7:9–10).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, great King over all the earth,
thank You for calling every nation to clap and shout in joy.
Let us exalt You, unite as Your people, praise Your name.
In the eternal day, let every tongue confess You as Lord.
Come quickly, our Sovereign King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
