# My God, Where Are You - என் தேவா நீர் எங்கே

This song of longing and patient hope echoes Psalm 42 — “As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God. My soul thirsts for God… Why, my soul, are you downcast? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him.” It is a cry of the soul in distress, thirsting for the living God amid oppression, yet choosing to wait and hope. In the eternal day, this thirst is fully satisfied — we drink from the river of life with the Lamb (Revelation 22:1).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, living Water and our deepest hope,
thank You for hearing our soul’s cry when we feel forsaken.
Let us pant for You, wait patiently, put our hope in You.
In the eternal day, let us drink from Your river forever.
Come quickly, our Living God.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
