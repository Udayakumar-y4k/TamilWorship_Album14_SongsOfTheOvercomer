# Your Light and Truth - உம் வெளிச்சமும் உம் சத்தியமும்

This song of radiant guidance and persistent praise echoes Psalm 43 — “Send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling! Why are you cast down, O my soul? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.” It is a cry for divine leading amid oppression, choosing to praise despite sorrow. In the eternal day, this guidance is perfected — we stand in His holy place forever, praising without end (Revelation 7:15).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Light and Truth of the world,
thank You for sending Your light to guide us to Your dwelling.
Lift our downcast souls, let us hope in You alone.
In the eternal day, let us praise You in Your holy place forever.
Come quickly, our Guide and Salvation.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
