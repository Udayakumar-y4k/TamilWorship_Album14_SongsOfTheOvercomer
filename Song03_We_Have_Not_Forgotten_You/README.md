# We Have Not Forgotten You - உம்மை நாங்கள் மறக்கவில்லை

This song of faithful endurance and covenant loyalty echoes Psalm 44 — “We have not forgotten you, nor have we been false to your covenant… For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.” Yet victory is declared through the One who loved us (Romans 8:36–37). In the eternal day, this faithfulness is rewarded — no more reproach, only eternal triumph with the Lamb (Revelation 7:14–17).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, faithful to Your covenant,
thank You for sustaining us even when we face reproach.
Let us not forget You, nor turn from Your way.
In the eternal day, let us stand victorious in Your love.
Come quickly, our Faithful King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
