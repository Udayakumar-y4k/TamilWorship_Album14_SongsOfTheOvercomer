# I Sing of the King - நான் ராஜாவைப் பாடுகிறேன்

This song of poetic celebration and overflowing heart echoes Psalm 45 — “My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe. You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips.” It is a royal wedding psalm pointing to Christ the King, whose beauty and grace win victory. In the eternal day, this praise is perfected — we sing of the King forever in His majesty (Revelation 19:6–7).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, King of kings and fairest of all,
thank You for grace poured upon Your lips and victory in Your majesty.
Let our hearts overflow with praise for You.
In the eternal day, let us sing of Your beauty forever.
Come quickly, our Royal Bridegroom.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
