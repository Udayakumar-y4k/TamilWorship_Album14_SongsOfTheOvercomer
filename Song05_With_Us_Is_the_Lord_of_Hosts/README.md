# With Us Is the Lord of Hosts - நம்மோடிருக்கிறார் சேனைகளின் கர்த்தர்

This song of confident refuge and divine protection echoes Psalm 46 — “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way… The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.” It declares God’s presence amid chaos — wars, earthquakes, floods — and calls us to trust His unchanging help. In the eternal day, this refuge is perfected — no more shaking earth, only the unshakable kingdom with the Lamb (Hebrews 12:28; Revelation 21:1).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Lord of Hosts and our unshakable Refuge,
thank You for being with us in every trouble.
Let us fear not, though the earth shake.
In the eternal day, let us dwell in Your presence forever.
Come quickly, our Fortress and King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
